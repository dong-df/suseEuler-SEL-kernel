Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm2711-rpi-4-b: Fix usb's unit address
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.75

commit 3f32472854614d6f53b09b4812372dba9fc5c7de upstream.

The unit address is supposed to represent '<device>,<function>'. Which
are both 0 for RPi4b's XHCI controller. On top of that although
OpenFirmware states bus number goes in the high part of the last reg
parameter, FDT doesn't seem to care for it[1], so remove it.
