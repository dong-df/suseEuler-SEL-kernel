Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dp: correct 1.62G link rate at
 dp_catalog_ctrl_config_msa()
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.150

[ Upstream commit aa0bff10af1c4b92e6b56e3e1b7f81c660d3ba78 ]

At current implementation there is an extra 0 at 1.62G link rate which
cause no correct pixel_div selected for 1.62G link rate to calculate
mvid and nvid. This patch delete the extra 0 to have mvid and nvid be
calculated correctly.

Changes in v2:
-- fix Fixes tag's text

Changes in v3:
-- fix misspelling of "Reviewed-by"

Fixes: 937f941ca06f  ("drm/msm/dp: Use qmp phy for DP PLL and PHY")
