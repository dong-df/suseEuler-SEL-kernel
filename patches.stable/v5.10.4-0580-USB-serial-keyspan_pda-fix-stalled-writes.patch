Subject: [PATCH] USB: serial: keyspan_pda: fix stalled writes
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.4

commit c01d2c58698f710c9e13ba3e2d296328606f74fd upstream.

Make sure to clear the write-busy flag also in case no new data was
submitted due to lack of device buffer space so that writing is
resumed once space again becomes available.

Fixes: 507ca9bc0476 ("[PATCH] USB: add ability for usb-serial drivers to determine if their write urb is currently being used.")
