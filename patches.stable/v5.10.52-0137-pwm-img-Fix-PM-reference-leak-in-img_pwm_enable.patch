Subject: [PATCH] pwm: img: Fix PM reference leak in img_pwm_enable()
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.52

[ Upstream commit fde25294dfd8e36e4e30b693c27a86232864002a ]

pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter even it failed.
Forgetting to putting operation will result in reference leak here.
Fix it by replacing it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage
counter balanced.
