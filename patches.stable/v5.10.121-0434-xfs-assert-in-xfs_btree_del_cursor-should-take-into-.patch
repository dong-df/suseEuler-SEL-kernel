Subject: [PATCH] xfs: assert in xfs_btree_del_cursor should take into account
 error
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.121

commit 56486f307100e8fc66efa2ebd8a71941fa10bf6f upstream.

xfs/538 on a 1kB block filesystem failed with this assert:

XFS: Assertion failed: cur->bc_btnum != XFS_BTNUM_BMAP || cur->bc_ino.allocated == 0 || xfs_is_shutdown(cur->bc_mp), file: fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_btree.c, line: 448

The problem was that an allocation failed unexpectedly in
xfs_bmbt_alloc_block() after roughly 150,000 minlen allocation error
injections, resulting in an EFSCORRUPTED error being returned to
xfs_bmapi_write(). The error occurred on extent-to-btree format
conversion allocating the new root block:

 RIP: 0010:xfs_bmbt_alloc_block+0x177/0x210
 Call Trace:

  do_syscall_64+0x35/0x80
  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa

Why the allocation failed at this point is unknown, but is likely
that we ran the transaction out of reserved space and filesystem out
of space with bmbt blocks because of all the minlen allocations
being done causing worst case fragmentation of a large allocation.

Regardless of the cause, we've then called xfs_bmapi_finish() which
calls xfs_btree_del_cursor(cur, error) to tear down the cursor.

So we have a failed operation, error != 0, cur->bc_ino.allocated > 0
and the filesystem is still up. The assert fails to take into
account that allocation can fail with an error and the transaction
teardown will shut the filesystem down if necessary. i.e. the
assert needs to check "|| error != 0" as well, because at this point
shutdown is pending because the current transaction is dirty....
