Subject: [PATCH] nvme-loop: reset queue count to 1 in
 nvme_loop_destroy_io_queues()
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.45

[ Upstream commit a6c144f3d2e230f2b3ac5ed8c51e0f0391556197 ]

The queue count is increased in nvme_loop_init_io_queues(), so we
need to reset it to 1 at the end of nvme_loop_destroy_io_queues().
Otherwise the function is not re-entrant safe, and crash will happen
during concurrent reset and remove calls.
