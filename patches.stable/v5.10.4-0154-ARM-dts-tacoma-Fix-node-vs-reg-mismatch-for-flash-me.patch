Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: tacoma: Fix node vs reg mismatch for flash memory
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.4

[ Upstream commit cbee028da69d31cb927142e2828710de55a49f2a ]

The mismatch lead to a miscalculation of regions in another patch, and
shouldn't be mismatched anyway, so make them consistent.
