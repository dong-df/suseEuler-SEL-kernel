Subject: [PATCH] net: nfc: nci: Change the NCI close sequence
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.82

[ Upstream commit f011539e723c737b74876ac47345e40270a3c384 ]

If there is a NCI command in work queue after closing the NCI device at
nci_unregister_device, The NCI command timer starts at flush_workqueue
function and then NCI command timeout handler would be called 5 second
after flushing the NCI command work queue and destroying the queue.
At that time, the timeout handler would try to use NCI command work queue
that is destroyed already. it will causes the problem. To avoid this
abnormal situation, change the sequence to prevent the NCI command timeout
handler from being called after destroying the NCI command work queue.
