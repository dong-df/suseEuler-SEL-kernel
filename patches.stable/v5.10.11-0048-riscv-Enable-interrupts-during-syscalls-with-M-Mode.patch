Subject: [PATCH] riscv: Enable interrupts during syscalls with M-Mode
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.11

[ Upstream commit 643437b996bac9267785e0bd528332e2d5811067 ]

When running is M-Mode (no MMU config), MPIE does not get set. This
results in all syscalls being executed with interrupts disabled as
handle_exception never sets SR_IE as it always sees SR_PIE being
cleared. Fix this by always force enabling interrupts in
handle_syscall when CONFIG_RISCV_M_MODE is enabled.
