Subject: [PATCH] sched/membarrier: Fix membarrier-rseq fence command missing
 from query bitmask
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.96

commit 809232619f5b15e31fb3563985e705454f32621f upstream.

The membarrier command MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY allows querying the
available membarrier commands. When the membarrier-rseq fence commands
were added, a new MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ_BITMASK was
introduced with the intent to expose them with the MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY
command, the but it was never added to MEMBARRIER_CMD_BITMASK.

The membarrier-rseq fence commands are therefore not wired up with the
query command.

Rename MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ_BITMASK to
MEMBARRIER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ_BITMASK (the bitmask is not a command
per-se), and change the erroneous
MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ_BITMASK (which does not
actually exist) to MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ.

Wire up MEMBARRIER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ_BITMASK in
MEMBARRIER_CMD_BITMASK. Fixing this allows discovering availability of
the membarrier-rseq fence feature.
