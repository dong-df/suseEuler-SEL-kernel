Subject: [PATCH] Makefile.debug: re-enable debug info for .S files
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.152

This is _not_ an upstream commit and just for 5.10.y only. It is based
on commit 32ef9e5054ec0321b9336058c58ec749e9c6b0fe upstream.

Alexey reported that the fraction of unknown filename instances in
kallsyms grew from ~0.3% to ~10% recently; Bill and Greg tracked it down
to assembler defined symbols, which regressed as a result of:

commit b8a9092330da ("Kbuild: do not emit debug info for assembly with LLVM_IAS=1")

In that commit, I allude to restoring debug info for assembler defined
symbols in a follow up patch, but it seems I forgot to do so in

commit a66049e2cf0e ("Kbuild: make DWARF version a choice")

Fixes: b8a9092330da ("Kbuild: do not emit debug info for assembly with LLVM_IAS=1")
