Subject: [PATCH] lockdep: Add a missing initialization hint to the "INFO:
 Trying to register non-static key" message
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.32

[ Upstream commit 3a85969e9d912d5dd85362ee37b5f81266e00e77 ]

Since this message is printed when dynamically allocated spinlocks (e.g.
kzalloc()) are used without initialization (e.g. spin_lock_init()),
suggest to developers to check whether initialization functions for objects
were called, before making developers wonder what annotation is missing.

[ mingo: Minor tweaks to the message. ]
