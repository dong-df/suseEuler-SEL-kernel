Subject: [PATCH] fscrypt: fix keyring memory leak on mount failure
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.154

commit ccd30a476f8e864732de220bd50e6f372f5ebcab upstream.

Commit d7e7b9af104c ("fscrypt: stop using keyrings subsystem for
fscrypt_master_key") moved the keyring destruction from __put_super() to
generic_shutdown_super() so that the filesystem's block device(s) are
still available.  Unfortunately, this causes a memory leak in the case
where a mount is attempted with the test_dummy_encryption mount option,
but the mount fails after the option has already been processed.

To fix this, attempt the keyring destruction in both places.
