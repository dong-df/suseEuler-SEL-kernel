Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: cadence: only prepare attached devices on clock
 stop
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.36

[ Upstream commit 58ef9356260c291a4321e07ff507f31a1d8212af ]

We sometimes see COMMAND_IGNORED responses during the clock stop
sequence. It turns out we already have information if devices are
present on a link, so we should only prepare those when they
are attached.

In addition, even when COMMAND_IGNORED are received, we should still
proceed with the clock stop. The device will not be prepared but
that's not a problem.

The only case where the clock stop will fail is if the Cadence IP
reports an error (including a timeout), or if the devices throw a
COMMAND_FAILED response.
