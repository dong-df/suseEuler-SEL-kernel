Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx7: Move hsic_phy power domain to HSIC PHY node
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.127

commit 552ca27929ab28b341ae9b2629f0de3a84c98ee8 upstream.

Move the power domain to its actual user. This keeps the power domain
enabled even when the USB host is runtime suspended. This is necessary
to detect any downstream events, like device attach.
