Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: fix pinctrl sleep nodename for
 rk3399.dtsi
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.53

[ Upstream commit a7ecfad495f8af63a5cb332c91f60ab2018897f5 ]

A test with the command below aimed at powerpc generates
notifications in the Rockchip arm64 tree.

Fix pinctrl "sleep" nodename by renaming it to "suspend"
for rk3399.dtsi
