Subject: [PATCH] locking/lockdep: Fix the dep path printing for backwards BFS
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.50

[ Upstream commit 69c7a5fb2482636f525f016c8333fdb9111ecb9d ]

We use the same code to print backwards lock dependency path as the
forwards lock dependency path, and this could result into incorrect
printing because for a backwards lock_list ->trace is not the call trace
where the lock of ->class is acquired.

Fix this by introducing a separate function on printing the backwards
dependency path. Also add a few comments about the printing while we are
at it.

 /*
- * printk the shortest lock dependencies from @start to @end in reverse order:
+ * Dependency path printing:
+ *
+ * After BFS we get a lock dependency path (linked via ->parent of lock_list),
+ * printing out each lock in the dependency path will help on understanding how
+ * the deadlock could happen. Here are some details about dependency path
+ * printing:
+ *
+ * 1)	A lock_list can be either forwards or backwards for a lock dependency,
+ * 	for a lock dependency A -> B, there are two lock_lists:
+ *
+ * 	a)	lock_list in the ->locks_after list of A, whose ->class is B and
+ * 		->links_to is A. In this case, we can say the lock_list is
+ * 		"A -> B" (forwards case).
+ *
+ * 	b)	lock_list in the ->locks_before list of B, whose ->class is A
+ * 		and ->links_to is B. In this case, we can say the lock_list is
+ * 		"B <- A" (bacwards case).
+ *
+ * 	The ->trace of both a) and b) point to the call trace where B was
+ * 	acquired with A held.
+ *
+ * 2)	A "helper" lock_list is introduced during BFS, this lock_list doesn't
+ * 	represent a certain lock dependency, it only provides an initial entry
+ * 	for BFS. For example, BFS may introduce a "helper" lock_list whose
+ * 	->class is A, as a result BFS will search all dependencies starting with
+ * 	A, e.g. A -> B or A -> C.
+ *
+ * 	The notation of a forwards helper lock_list is like "-> A", which means
+ * 	we should search the forwards dependencies starting with "A", e.g A -> B
+ * 	or A -> C.
+ *
+ * 	The notation of a bacwards helper lock_list is like "<- B", which means
+ * 	we should search the backwards dependencies ending with "B", e.g.
+ * 	B <- A or B <- C.
