Subject: [PATCH] page_alloc: fix invalid watermark check on a negative value
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.135

commit 9282012fc0aa248b77a69f5eb802b67c5a16bb13 upstream.

There was a report that a task is waiting at the
throttle_direct_reclaim. The pgscan_direct_throttle in vmstat was
increasing.

This is a bug where zone_watermark_fast returns true even when the free
is very low. The commit f27ce0e14088 ("page_alloc: consider highatomic
reserve in watermark fast") changed the watermark fast to consider
highatomic reserve. But it did not handle a negative value case which
can be happened when reserved_highatomic pageblock is bigger than the
actual free.

If watermark is considered as ok for the negative value, allocating
contexts for order-0 will consume all free pages without direct reclaim,
and finally free page may become depleted except highatomic free.

Then allocating contexts may fall into throttle_direct_reclaim. This
symptom may easily happen in a system where wmark min is low and other
reclaimers like kswapd does not make free pages quickly.

Handle the negative case by using MIN.
