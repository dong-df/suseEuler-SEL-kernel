Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: s5pv210: Remove spi-cs-high on panel in Aries
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.121

commit 096f58507374e1293a9e9cff8a1ccd5f37780a20 upstream.

Since commit 766c6b63aa04 ("spi: fix client driver breakages when using
GPIO descriptors"), the panel has been blank due to an inverted CS GPIO.
In order to correct this, drop the spi-cs-high from the panel SPI device.
