Subject: [PATCH] Revert "cpufreq: Fix possible race in cpufreq online error
 path"
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.121

[ Upstream commit 85f0e42bd65d01b351d561efb38e584d4c596553 ]

This reverts commit f346e96267cd76175d6c201b40f770c0116a8a04.

The commit tried to fix a possible real bug but it made it even worse.
The fix was simply buggy as now an error out to out_offline_policy or
out_exit_policy will try to release a semaphore which was never taken in
the first place. This works fine only if we failed late, i.e. via
out_destroy_policy.
