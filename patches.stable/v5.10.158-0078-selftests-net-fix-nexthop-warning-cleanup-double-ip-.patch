Subject: [PATCH] selftests: net: fix nexthop warning cleanup double ip typo
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.158

[ Upstream commit 692930cc435099580a4b9e32fa781b0688c18439 ]

I made a stupid typo when adding the nexthop route warning selftest and
added both $IP and ip after it (double ip) on the cleanup path. The
error doesn't show up when running the test, but obviously it doesn't
cleanup properly after it.
