Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm2711: fix MDIO #address- and #size-cells
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.75

commit 2faff6737a8a684b077264f0aed131526c99eec4 upstream.

The values of #address-cells and #size-cells are swapped. Fix this
and avoid the following DT schema warnings for mdio@e14:

 #address-cells:0:0: 1 was expected
 #size-cells:0:0: 0 was expected
