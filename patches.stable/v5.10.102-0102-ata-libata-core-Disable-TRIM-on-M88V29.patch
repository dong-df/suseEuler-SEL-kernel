[ Upstream commit c8ea23d5fa59f28302d4e3370c75d9c308e64410 ]

This device is a CF card, or possibly an SSD in CF form factor.
It supports NCQ and high speed DMA.

While it also advertises TRIM support, I/O errors are reported
when the discard mount option fstrim is used. TRIM also fails
when disabling NCQ and not just as an NCQ command.

TRIM must be disabled for this device.
