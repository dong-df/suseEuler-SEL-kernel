Subject: [PATCH] net: ipa: fix table alignment requirement
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.146

[ Upstream commit e5d4e96b44cf20330c970c3e30ea0a8c3a23feca ]

We currently have a build-time check to ensure that the minimum DMA
allocation alignment satisfies the constraint that IPA filter and
route tables must point to rules that are 128-byte aligned.

But what's really important is that the actual allocated DMA memory
has that alignment, even if the minimum is smaller than that.

Remove the BUILD_BUG_ON() call checking against minimim DMA alignment
and instead verify at rutime that the allocated memory is properly
aligned.
