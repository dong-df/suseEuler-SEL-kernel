Subject: [PATCH] random: restore O_NONBLOCK support
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.148

commit cd4f24ae9404fd31fc461066e57889be3b68641b upstream.

Prior to 5.6, when /dev/random was opened with O_NONBLOCK, it would
return -EAGAIN if there was no entropy. When the pools were unified in
5.6, this was lost. The post 5.6 behavior of blocking until the pool is
initialized, and ignoring O_NONBLOCK in the process, went unnoticed,
with no reports about the regression received for two and a half years.
However, eventually this indeed did break somebody's userspace.

So we restore the old behavior, by returning -EAGAIN if the pool is not
initialized. Unlike the old /dev/random, this can only occur during
early boot, after which it never blocks again.

In order to make this O_NONBLOCK behavior consistent with other
expectations, also respect users reading with preadv2(RWF_NOWAIT) and
similar.

Fixes: 30c08efec888 ("random: make /dev/random be almost like /dev/urandom")
