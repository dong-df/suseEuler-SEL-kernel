Subject: [PATCH] mark pstore-blk as broken
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.50

[ Upstream commit d07f3b081ee632268786601f55e1334d1f68b997 ]

pstore-blk just pokes directly into the pagecache for the block
device without going through the file operations for that by faking
up it's own file operations that do not match the block device ones.

As this breaks the control of the block layer of it's page cache,
and even now just works by accident only the best thing is to just
disable this driver.
