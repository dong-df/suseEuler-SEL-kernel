Subject: [PATCH] s390/dasd: Fix read for ESE with blksize < 4k

commit cd68c48ea15c85f1577a442dc4c285e112ff1b37 upstream.

When reading unformatted tracks on ESE devices, the corresponding memory
areas are simply set to zero for each segment. This is done incorrectly
for blocksizes < 4096.

There are two problems. First, the increment of dst is done using the
counter of the loop (off), which is increased by blksize every
iteration. This leads to a much bigger increment for dst as actually
intended. Second, the increment of dst is done before the memory area
is set to 0, skipping a significant amount of bytes of memory.

This leads to illegal overwriting of memory and ultimately to a kernel
panic.

This is not a problem with 4k blocksize because
blk_queue_max_segment_size is set to PAGE_SIZE, always resulting in a
single iteration for the inner segment loop (bv.bv_len == blksize). The
incorrectly used 'off' value to increment dst is 0 and the correct
memory area is used.

In order to fix this for blksize < 4k, increment dst correctly using the
blksize and only do it at the end of the loop.
