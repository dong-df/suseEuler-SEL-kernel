Subject: [PATCH] ata: pata_hpt37x: disable primary channel on HPT371
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.103

commit 8d093e02e898b24c58788b0289e3202317a96d2a upstream.

The HPT371 chip physically has only one channel, the secondary one,
however the primary channel registers do exist! Thus we have to
manually disable the non-existing channel if the BIOS hasn't done this
already. Similarly to the pata_hpt3x2n driver, always disable the
primary channel.
