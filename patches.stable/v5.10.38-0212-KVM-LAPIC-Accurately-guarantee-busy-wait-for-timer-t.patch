Subject: [PATCH] KVM: LAPIC: Accurately guarantee busy wait for timer to
 expire when using hv_timer
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.38

[ Upstream commit d981dd15498b188636ec5a7d8ad485e650f63d8d ]

Commit ee66e453db13d (KVM: lapic: Busy wait for timer to expire when
using hv_timer) tries to set ktime->expired_tscdeadline by checking
ktime->hv_timer_in_use since lapic timer oneshot/periodic modes which
are emulated by vmx preemption timer also get advanced, they leverage
the same vmx preemption timer logic with tsc-deadline mode. However,
ktime->hv_timer_in_use is cleared before apic_timer_expired() handling,
let's delay this clearing in preemption-disabled region.
