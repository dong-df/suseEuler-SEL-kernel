Subject: [PATCH] USB: cdc-acm: fix break reporting
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.73

commit 58fc1daa4d2e9789b9ffc880907c961ea7c062cc upstream.

A recent change that started reporting break events forgot to push the
event to the line discipline, which meant that a detected break would
not be reported until further characters had been receive (the port
could even have been closed and reopened in between).
