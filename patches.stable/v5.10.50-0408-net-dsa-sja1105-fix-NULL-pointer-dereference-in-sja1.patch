Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: sja1105: fix NULL pointer dereference in
 sja1105_reload_cbs()
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.50

[ Upstream commit be7f62eebaff2f86c1467a2d33930a0a7a87675b ]

priv->cbs is an array of priv->info->num_cbs_shapers elements of type
struct sja1105_cbs_entry which only get allocated if CONFIG_NET_SCH_CBS
is enabled.

However, sja1105_reload_cbs() is called from sja1105_static_config_reload()
which in turn is called for any of the items in sja1105_reset_reasons,
therefore during the normal runtime of the driver and not just from a
code path which can be triggered by the tc-cbs offload.

The sja1105_reload_cbs() function does not contain a check whether the
priv->cbs array is NULL or not, it just assumes it isn't and proceeds to
iterate through the credit-based shaper elements. This leads to a NULL
pointer dereference.

The solution is to return success if the priv->cbs array has not been
allocated, since sja1105_reload_cbs() has nothing to do.
