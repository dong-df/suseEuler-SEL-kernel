Subject: [PATCH] net: macb: Restart tx only if queue pointer is lagging
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.113

[ Upstream commit 5ad7f18cd82cee8e773d40cc7a1465a526f2615c ]

commit 4298388574da ("net: macb: restart tx after tx used bit read")
added support for restarting transmission. Restarting tx does not work
in case controller asserts TXUBR interrupt and TQBP is already at the end
of the tx queue. In that situation, restarting tx will immediately cause
assertion of another TXUBR interrupt. The driver will end up in an infinite
interrupt loop which it cannot break out of.

For cases where TQBP is at the end of the tx queue, instead
only clear TX_USED interrupt. As more data gets pushed to the queue,
transmission will resume.

This issue was observed on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 based board.
During stress test of the network interface,
driver would get stuck on interrupt loop within seconds or minutes
causing CPU to stall.
