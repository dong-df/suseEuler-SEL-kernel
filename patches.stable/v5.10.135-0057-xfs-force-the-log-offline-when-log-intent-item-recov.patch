Subject: [PATCH] xfs: force the log offline when log intent item recovery
 fails
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.135

commit 4e6b8270c820c8c57a73f869799a0af2b56eff3e upstream.

If any part of log intent item recovery fails, we should shut down the
log immediately to stop the log from writing a clean unmount record to
disk, because the metadata is not consistent.  The inability to cancel a
dirty transaction catches most of these cases, but there are a few
things that have slipped through the cracks, such as ENOSPC from a
transaction allocation, or runtime errors that result in cancellation of
a non-dirty transaction.

This solves some weird behaviors reported by customers where a system
goes down, the first mount fails, the second succeeds, but then the fs
goes down later because of inconsistent metadata.
