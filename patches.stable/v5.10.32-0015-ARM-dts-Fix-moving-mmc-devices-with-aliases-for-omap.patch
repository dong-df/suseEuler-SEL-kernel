Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: Fix moving mmc devices with aliases for omap4 & 5
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.32

[ Upstream commit 77335a040178a0456d4eabc8bf17a7ca3ee4a327 ]

Fix moving mmc devices with dts aliases as discussed on the lists.
Without this we now have internal eMMC mmc1 show up as mmc2 compared
to the earlier order of devices.
