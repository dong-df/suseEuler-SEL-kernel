Subject: [PATCH] HID: i2c-hid: Fix Elan touchpad regression
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.67

[ Upstream commit 786537063bbfb3a7ebc6fc21b2baf37fb91df401 ]

A quirk was recently added for Elan devices that has same device match
as an entry earlier in the list. The i2c_hid_lookup_quirk function will
always return the last match in the list, so the new entry shadows the
old entry. The quirk in the previous entry, I2C_HID_QUIRK_BOGUS_IRQ,
silenced a flood of messages which have reappeared in the 5.13 kernel.

This change moves the two quirk flags into the same entry.
