Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: Fix PKMAP with 32-bit MIPS huge page support
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.50

[ Upstream commit cf02ce742f09188272bcc8b0e62d789eb671fc4c ]

When 32-bit MIPS huge page support is enabled, we halve the number of
pointers a PTE page holds, making its last half go to waste.
Correspondingly, we should halve the number of kmap entries, as we just
initialized only a single pte table for that in pagetable_init().

Fixes: 35476311e529 ("MIPS: Add partial 32-bit huge page support")
