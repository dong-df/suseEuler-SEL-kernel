Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Filter out all unsupported controls when eVMCS was
 activated
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.71

commit 8d68bad6d869fae8f4d50ab6423538dec7da72d1 upstream.

Windows Server 2022 with Hyper-V role enabled failed to boot on KVM when
enlightened VMCS is advertised. Debugging revealed there are two exposed
secondary controls it is not happy with: SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_VMFUNC and
SECONDARY_EXEC_SHADOW_VMCS. These controls are known to be unsupported,
as there are no corresponding fields in eVMCSv1 (see the comment above
EVMCS1_UNSUPPORTED_2NDEXEC definition).

Previously, commit 31de3d2500e4 ("x86/kvm/hyper-v: move VMX controls
sanitization out of nested_enable_evmcs()") introduced the required
filtering mechanism for VMX MSRs but for some reason put only known
to be problematic (and not full EVMCS1_UNSUPPORTED_* lists) controls
there.

Note, Windows Server 2022 seems to have gained some sanity check for VMX
MSRs: it doesn't even try to launch a guest when there's something it
doesn't like, nested_evmcs_check_controls() mechanism can't catch the
problem.

Let's be bold this time and instead of playing whack-a-mole just filter out
all unsupported controls from VMX MSRs.

Fixes: 31de3d2500e4 ("x86/kvm/hyper-v: move VMX controls sanitization out of nested_enable_evmcs()")
