Subject: [PATCH] ixgbe: Document how to enable NBASE-T support
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.88

[ Upstream commit 271225fd57c2f1e0b3f8826df51be6c634affefe ]

Commit a296d665eae1 ("ixgbe: Add ethtool support to enable 2.5 and 5.0
Gbps support") introduced suppression of the advertisement of NBASE-T
speeds by default, according to Todd Fujinaka to accommodate customers
with network switches which could not cope with advertised NBASE-T
speeds, as posted in the E1000-devel mailing list:

https://sourceforge.net/p/e1000/mailman/message/37106269/

However, the suppression was not documented at all, nor was how to
enable NBASE-T support.

Properly document the NBASE-T suppression and how to enable NBASE-T
support.

+NBASE-T Support
+---------------
+The ixgbe driver supports NBASE-T on some devices. However, the advertisement
+of NBASE-T speeds is suppressed by default, to accommodate broken network
+switches which cannot cope with advertised NBASE-T speeds. Use the ethtool
+command to enable advertising NBASE-T speeds on devices which support it::
+
+  ethtool -s eth? advertise 0x1800000001028
+
+On Linux systems with INTERFACES(5), this can be specified as a pre-up command
+in /etc/network/interfaces so that the interface is always brought up with
+NBASE-T support, e.g.::
+
+  iface eth? inet dhcp
+       pre-up ethtool -s eth? advertise 0x1800000001028 || true
+
 Generic Receive Offload, aka GRO
 --------------------------------
 The driver supports the in-kernel software implementation of GRO. GRO has
