Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: sb: Fix two use after free in snd_sb_qsound_build
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.36

commit 4fb44dd2c1dda18606348acdfdb97e8759dde9df upstream.

In snd_sb_qsound_build, snd_ctl_add(..,p->qsound_switch...) and
snd_ctl_add(..,p->qsound_space..) are called. But the second
arguments of snd_ctl_add() could be freed via snd_ctl_add_replace()
->snd_ctl_free_one(). After the error code is returned,
snd_sb_qsound_destroy(p) is called in __error branch.

But in snd_sb_qsound_destroy(), the freed p->qsound_switch and
p->qsound_space are still used by snd_ctl_remove().

My patch set p->qsound_switch and p->qsound_space to NULL if
snd_ctl_add() failed to avoid the uaf bugs. But these codes need
to further be improved with the code style.
