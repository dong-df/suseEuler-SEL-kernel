Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: kirkwood: lsxl: remove first ethernet port
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.150

[ Upstream commit 2d528eda7c96ce5c70f895854ecd5684bd5d80b9 ]

Both the Linkstation LS-CHLv2 and the LS-XHL have only one ethernet
port. This has always been wrong, i.e. the board code used to set up
both ports, but the driver will play nice and return -ENODEV if the
assiciated PHY is not found. Nevertheless, it is wrong. Remove it.
