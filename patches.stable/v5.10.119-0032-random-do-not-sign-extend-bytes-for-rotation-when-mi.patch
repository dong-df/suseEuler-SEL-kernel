Subject: [PATCH] random: do not sign extend bytes for rotation when mixing
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.119

commit 0d9488ffbf2faddebc6bac055bfa6c93b94056a3 upstream.

By using `char` instead of `unsigned char`, certain platforms will sign
extend the byte when `w = rol32(*bytes++, input_rotate)` is called,
meaning that bit 7 is overrepresented when mixing. This isn't a real
problem (unless the mixer itself is already broken) since it's still
invertible, but it's not quite correct either. Fix this by using an
explicit unsigned type.
