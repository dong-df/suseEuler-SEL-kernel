Subject: [PATCH] nvme-pci: add NO APST quirk for Kioxia device
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.127

[ Upstream commit 5a6254d55e2a9f7919ead8580d7aa0c7a382b26a ]

This particular Kioxia device times out and aborts I/O during any load,
but it's more easily observable with discards (fstrim).

The device gets to a state that is also not possible to use
"nvme set-feature" to disable APST.
Booting with nvme_core.default_ps_max_latency=0 solves the issue.

We had a dozen or so of these devices behaving this same way in
customer environments.
