Subject: [PATCH] riscv: Make VM_WRITE imply VM_READ
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.150

commit 7ab72c597356be1e7f0f3d856e54ce78527f43c8 upstream.

RISC-V does not presently have write-only mappings as that PTE bit pattern
is considered reserved in the privileged spec, so allow handling of read
faults in VMAs that have VM_WRITE without VM_READ in order to be consistent
with other architectures that have similar limitations.

Fixes: 2139619bcad7 ("riscv: mmap with PROT_WRITE but no PROT_READ is invalid")
