Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Restrict ARM64_BTI_KERNEL to clang 12.0.0 and newer
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.146

[ Upstream commit 8cdd23c23c3d481a43b4aa03dcb5738812831115 ]

Commit 97fed779f2a6 ("arm64: bti: Provide Kconfig for kernel mode BTI")
disabled CONFIG_ARM64_BTI_KERNEL when CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was enabled and
compiling with clang because of warnings that were seen with
allmodconfig because LLVM was not emitting PAC/BTI instructions for
compiler generated functions:

  | warning: some functions compiled with BTI and some compiled without BTI
  | warning: not setting BTI in feature flags

This dependency was fine for avoiding the warnings with allmodconfig
until commit 51c2ee6d121c ("Kconfig: Introduce ARCH_WANTS_NO_INSTR and
CC_HAS_NO_PROFILE_FN_ATTR"), which prevents CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL from
being enabled with clang 12.0.0 or older because those versions do not
support the no_profile_instrument_function attribute.

As a result, CONFIG_ARM64_BTI_KERNEL gets enabled with allmodconfig and
there are more warnings like the ones above due to CONFIG_KASAN, which
suffers from the same problem as CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL. This was most
likely not noticed at the time because allmodconfig +
CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL=n was not tested. defconfig + CONFIG_KASAN=y is
enough to reproduce the same warnings as above.

The root cause of the warnings was resolved in LLVM during the 12.0.0
release so rather than play whack-a-mole with the dependencies, just
update CONFIG_ARM64_BTI_KERNEL to require clang 12.0.0, which will have
all of the issues ironed out.
