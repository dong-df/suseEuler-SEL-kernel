Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: tacoma: Add phase corrections for eMMC
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.53

commit 2d6608b57c50c54c3e46649110e8ea5a40959c30 upstream.

The degree values were reversed out from the magic tap values of 7 (in)
and 15 + inversion (out) initially suggested by Aspeed.

With the patch tacoma survives several gigabytes of reads and writes
using dd while without it locks up randomly during the boot process.
