Subject: [PATCH] mm: memcg/slab: properly set up gfp flags for objcg pointer
 array
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.50

[ Upstream commit 41eb5df1cbc9b302fc263ad7c9f38cfc38b4df61 ]

Patch series "mm: memcg/slab: Fix objcg pointer array handling problem", v4.

Since the merging of the new slab memory controller in v5.9, the page
structure stores a pointer to objcg pointer array for slab pages.  When
the slab has no used objects, it can be freed in free_slab() which will
call kfree() to free the objcg pointer array in
memcg_alloc_page_obj_cgroups().  If it happens that the objcg pointer
array is the last used object in its slab, that slab may then be freed
which may caused kfree() to be called again.

With the right workload, the slab cache may be set up in a way that allows
the recursive kfree() calling loop to nest deep enough to cause a kernel
stack overflow and panic the system.  In fact, we have a reproducer that
can cause kernel stack overflow on a s390 system involving kmalloc-rcl-256
and kmalloc-rcl-128 slabs with the following kfree() loop recursively
called 74 times:

  [ 285.520739] [<000000000ec432fc>] kfree+0x4bc/0x560 [ 285.520740]
[<000000000ec43466>] __free_slab+0xc6/0x228 [ 285.520741]
[<000000000ec41fc2>] __slab_free+0x3c2/0x3e0 [ 285.520742]
[<000000000ec432fc>] kfree+0x4bc/0x560 : While investigating this issue, I
also found an issue on the allocation side.  If the objcg pointer array
happen to come from the same slab or a circular dependency linkage is
formed with multiple slabs, those affected slabs can never be freed again.

This patch series addresses these two issues by introducing a new set of
kmalloc-cg-<n> caches split from kmalloc-<n> caches.  The new set will
only contain non-reclaimable and non-dma objects that are accounted in
memory cgroups whereas the old set are now for unaccounted objects only.
By making this split, all the objcg pointer arrays will come from the
kmalloc-<n> caches, but those caches will never hold any objcg pointer
array.  As a result, deeply nested kfree() call and the unfreeable slab
problems are now gone.

This patch (of 4):

Since the merging of the new slab memory controller in v5.9, the page
structure may store a pointer to obj_cgroup pointer array for slab pages.
Currently, only the __GFP_ACCOUNT bit is masked off.  However, the array
is not readily reclaimable and doesn't need to come from the DMA buffer.
So those GFP bits should be masked off as well.

Do the flag bit clearing at memcg_alloc_page_obj_cgroups() to make sure
that it is consistently applied no matter where it is called.
