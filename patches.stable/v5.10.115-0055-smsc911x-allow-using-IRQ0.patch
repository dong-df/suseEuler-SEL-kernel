Subject: [PATCH] smsc911x: allow using IRQ0
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.115

commit 5ef9b803a4af0f5e42012176889b40bb2a978b18 upstream.

The AlphaProject AP-SH4A-3A/AP-SH4AD-0A SH boards use IRQ0 for their SMSC
LAN911x Ethernet chip, so the networking on them must have been broken by
commit 965b2aa78fbc ("net/smsc911x: fix irq resource allocation failure")
which filtered out 0 as well as the negative error codes -- it was kinda
correct at the time, as platform_get_irq() could return 0 on of_irq_get()
failure and on the actual 0 in an IRQ resource.  This issue was fixed by
me (back in 2016!), so we should be able to fix this driver to allow IRQ0
usage again...

When merging this to the stable kernels, make sure you also merge commit
e330b9a6bb35 ("platform: don't return 0 from platform_get_irq[_byname]()
on error") -- that's my fix to platform_get_irq() for the DT platforms...
