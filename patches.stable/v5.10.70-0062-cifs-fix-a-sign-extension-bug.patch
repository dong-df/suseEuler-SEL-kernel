Subject: [PATCH] cifs: fix a sign extension bug
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.70

[ Upstream commit e946d3c887a9dc33aa82a349c6284f4a084163f4 ]

The problem is the mismatched types between "ctx->total_len" which is
an unsigned int, "rc" which is an int, and "ctx->rc" which is a
ssize_t.  The code does:

	ctx->rc = (rc == 0) ? ctx->total_len : rc;

We want "ctx->rc" to store the negative "rc" error code.  But what
happens is that "rc" is type promoted to a high unsigned int and
'ctx->rc" will store the high positive value instead of a negative
value.

The fix is to change "rc" from an int to a ssize_t.
