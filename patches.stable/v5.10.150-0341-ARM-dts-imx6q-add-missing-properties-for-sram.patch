Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6q: add missing properties for sram
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.150

[ Upstream commit b11d083c5dcec7c42fe982c854706d404ddd3a5f ]

All 3 properties are required by sram.yaml. Fixes the dtbs_check warning:
sram@900000: '#address-cells' is a required property
sram@900000: '#size-cells' is a required property
sram@900000: 'ranges' is a required property
