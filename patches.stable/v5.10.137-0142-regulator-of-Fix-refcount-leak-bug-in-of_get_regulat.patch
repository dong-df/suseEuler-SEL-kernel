Subject: [PATCH] regulator: of: Fix refcount leak bug in
 of_get_regulation_constraints()
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.137

[ Upstream commit 66efb665cd5ad69b27dca8571bf89fc6b9c628a4 ]

We should call the of_node_put() for the reference returned by
of_get_child_by_name() which has increased the refcount.

Fixes: 40e20d68bb3f ("regulator: of: Add support for parsing regulator_state for suspend state")
