Subject: [PATCH] cgroup: Use open-time credentials for process migraton perm
 checks

commit 1756d7994ad85c2479af6ae5a9750b92324685af upstream.

cgroup process migration permission checks are performed at write time as
whether a given operation is allowed or not is dependent on the content of
the write - the PID. This currently uses current's credentials which is a
potential security weakness as it may allow scenarios where a less
privileged process tricks a more privileged one into writing into a fd that
it created.

This patch makes both cgroup2 and cgroup1 process migration interfaces to
use the credentials saved at the time of open (file->f_cred) instead of
current's.

[OP: apply original __cgroup_procs_write() changes to cgroup_threads_write()
and cgroup_procs_write(), as the refactoring commit da70862efe006 ("cgroup:
cgroup.{procs,threads} factor out common parts") is not present in 5.10-stable]
