Git-commit: 1dbefa57725204be0348351ea4756c52b10b3504
From: Josh Poimboeuf <jpoimboe@kernel.org>

Subject: [PATCH] x86/speculation: Remove x86_spec_ctrl_mask
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.133

commit acac5e98ef8d638a411cfa2ee676c87e1973f126 upstream.

This mask has been made redundant by kvm_spec_ctrl_test_value().  And it
doesn't even work when MSR interception is disabled, as the guest can
just write to SPEC_CTRL directly.
