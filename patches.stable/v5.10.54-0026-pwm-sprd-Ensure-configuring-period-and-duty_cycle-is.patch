Subject: [PATCH] pwm: sprd: Ensure configuring period and duty_cycle isn't
 wrongly skipped

[ Upstream commit 65e2e6c1c20104ed19060a38f4edbf14e9f9a9a5 ]

As the last call to sprd_pwm_apply() might have exited early if
state->enabled was false, the values for period and duty_cycle stored in
pwm->state might not have been written to hardware and it must be
ensured that they are configured before enabling the PWM.
