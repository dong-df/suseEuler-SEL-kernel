Subject: [PATCH] clk: rockchip: drop GRF dependency for rk3328/rk3036 pll
 types
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.67

[ Upstream commit 6fffe52fb336ec2063270a7305652a93ea677ca1 ]

The rk3036/rk3328 pll types were converted to checking the lock status
via the internal register in january 2020, so don't need the grf
reference since then.

But it was forgotten to remove grf check when deciding between the
pll rate ops (read-only vs. read-write), so a clock driver without
the needed grf reference might've been put into the read-only mode
just because the grf reference was missing.

This affected the rk356x that needs to reclock certain plls at boot.

Fix this by removing the check for the grf for selecting the utilized
operations.
