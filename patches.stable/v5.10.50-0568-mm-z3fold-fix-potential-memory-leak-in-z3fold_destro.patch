Subject: [PATCH] mm/z3fold: fix potential memory leak in z3fold_destroy_pool()
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.50

[ Upstream commit dac0d1cfda56472378d330b1b76b9973557a7b1d ]

There is a memory leak in z3fold_destroy_pool() as it forgets to
free_percpu pool->unbuddied.  Call free_percpu for pool->unbuddied to fix
this issue.
