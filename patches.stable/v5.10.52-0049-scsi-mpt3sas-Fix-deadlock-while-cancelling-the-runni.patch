Subject: [PATCH] scsi: mpt3sas: Fix deadlock while cancelling the running
 firmware event
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.52

[ Upstream commit e2fac6c44ae06e58ac02181b048af31195883c31 ]

Do not cancel current running firmware event work if the event type is
different from MPT3SAS_REMOVE_UNRESPONDING_DEVICES.  Otherwise a deadlock
can be observed while cancelling the current firmware event work if a hard
reset operation is called as part of processing the current event.
