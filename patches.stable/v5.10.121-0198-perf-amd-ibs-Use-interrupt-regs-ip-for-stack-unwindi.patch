Subject: [PATCH] perf/amd/ibs: Use interrupt regs ip for stack unwinding
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.121

[ Upstream commit 3d47083b9ff46863e8374ad3bb5edb5e464c75f8 ]

IbsOpRip is recorded when IBS interrupt is triggered. But there is
a skid from the time IBS interrupt gets triggered to the time the
interrupt is presented to the core. Meanwhile processor would have
moved ahead and thus IbsOpRip will be inconsistent with rsp and rbp
recorded as part of the interrupt regs. This causes issues while
unwinding stack using the ORC unwinder as it needs consistent rip,
rsp and rbp. Fix this by using rip from interrupt regs instead of
IbsOpRip for stack unwinding.
