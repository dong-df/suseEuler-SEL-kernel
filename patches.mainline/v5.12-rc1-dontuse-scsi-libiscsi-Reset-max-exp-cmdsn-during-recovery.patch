Subject: [PATCH] scsi: libiscsi: Reset max/exp cmdsn during recovery
Git-commit: c8447e4c2eb77dbb96012ae96e7c83179cecf880
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc2
References: bsn#12


If we lose the session then relogin, but the new cmdsn window has shrunk
(due to something like an admin changing a setting) we will have the old
exp/max_cmdsn values and will never be able to update them. For example,
max_cmdsn would be 64, but if on the target the user set the window to be
smaller then the target could try to return the max_cmdsn as 32. We will
see that new max_cmdsn in the rsp but because it's lower than the old
max_cmdsn when the window was larger we will not update it.

So this patch has us reset the window values during session cleanup so they
can be updated after a new login.
