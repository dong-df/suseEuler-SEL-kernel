Subject: [PATCH] driver/perf: Remove ARM_SMMU_V3_PMU dependency on ARM_SMMU_V3
Git-commit: 34eb9359c111fd17ef8fb1ba671102438a7810c6
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc2
References: bsn#12


The ARM_SMMU_V3_PMU dependency on ARM_SMMU_V3_PMU was added with the idea
that a SMMUv3 PMCG would only exist on a system with an associated SMMUv3.

However it is not the job of Kconfig to make these sorts of decisions (even
if it were true), so remove the dependency.
