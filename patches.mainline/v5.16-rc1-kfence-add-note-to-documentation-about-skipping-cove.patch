Subject: [PATCH] kfence: add note to documentation about skipping covered

 allocations

Add a note briefly mentioning the new policy about "skipping currently
covered allocations if pool close to full." Since this has a notable
impact on KFENCE's bug-detection ability on systems with large uptimes,
it is worth pointing out the feature.

+If pool utilization reaches 75% (default) or above, to reduce the risk of the
+pool eventually being fully occupied by allocated objects yet ensure diverse
+coverage of allocations, KFENCE limits currently covered allocations of the
+same source from further filling up the pool. The "source" of an allocation is
+based on its partial allocation stack trace. A side-effect is that this also
+limits frequent long-lived allocations (e.g. pagecache) of the same source
+filling up the pool permanently, which is the most common risk for the pool
+becoming full and the sampled allocation rate dropping to zero. The threshold
+at which to start limiting currently covered allocations can be configured via
+the boot parameter ``kfence.skip_covered_thresh`` (pool usage%).
