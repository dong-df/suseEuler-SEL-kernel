Subject: [PATCH] arm64: assembler: introduce wxN aliases for wN registers
Git-commit: 4c4dcd3541f83d216f2e403cb83dd431e09759b1
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: bsn#12


The AArch64 asm syntax has this slightly tedious property that the names
used in mnemonics to refer to registers depend on whether the opcode in
question targets the entire 64-bits (xN), or only the least significant
8, 16 or 32 bits (wN). When writing parameterized code such as macros,
this can be annoying, as macro arguments don't lend themselves to
indexed lookups, and so generating a reference to wN in a macro that
receives xN as an argument is problematic.

For instance, an upcoming patch that modifies the implementation of the
cond_yield macro to be able to refer to 32-bit registers would need to
modify invocations such as

  cond_yield	3f, x8

to

  cond_yield	3f, 8

so that the second argument can be token pasted after x or w to emit the
correct register reference. Unfortunately, this interferes with the self
documenting nature of the first example, where the second argument is
obviously a register, whereas in the second example, one would need to
go and look at the code to find out what '8' means.

So let's fix this by defining wxN aliases for all xN registers, which
resolve to the 32-bit alias of each respective 64-bit register. This
allows the macro implementation to paste the xN reference after a w to
obtain the correct register name.
