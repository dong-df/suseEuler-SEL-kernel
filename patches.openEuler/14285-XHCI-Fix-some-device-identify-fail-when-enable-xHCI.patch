CVE: NA

----------------------------------------------------------------

If plug out device form xhci with runtime suspend enabled.
On the one hand, driver will disconnect this device and send disabled
slot command to xhci.
On the other hand, without no device connect to xhci, PM core will
call xhci suspend function to let xhci go to D3 to save power.
However there is a temporal competition to get xhci lock between
disable slot command interrupt and xhci suspend.
If xhci suspend function get xhci lock first, then this function will
clear xhci command ring. It will get error command trb when driver to
handle disable slot command interrupt. This is a serious error for
driver and driver will cleanup xhci. Soï¼Œany device connect to this
xhci port again will not be recognized.

In order to fix this issues, we let disable slot command interrupt ISR
to get xhci lock first. So, add a delay in xhci suspend function before
to get xhci lock.
