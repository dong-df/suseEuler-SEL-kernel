Subject: [PATCH] scsi: core: Introduce the scsi_cmd_to_rq() function
Git-commit: 51f3a478892873337c54068d1185bcd797000a52
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: bsn#61


The 'request' member of struct scsi_cmnd is superfluous. The struct request
and struct scsi_cmnd data structures are adjacent and hence the request
pointer can be derived easily from a scsi_cmnd pointer. Introduce a helper
function that performs that conversion in a type-safe way. This patch is
the first step towards removing the request member from struct
scsi_cmnd. Making that change has the following advantages:

 - This is a performance optimization since adding an offset to a pointer
   takes less time than dereferencing a pointer.

 - struct scsi_cmnd becomes smaller.
