Subject: [PATCH] scsi: lpfc: Correct function header comments related to ndlp
 reference counting
Git-commit: 69b8eff25c8beb8073d82ebb4cfb8a241540feba
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: bsn#61


Code inspection revealed stale comments in function headers for functions
that call lpfc_prep_els_iocb(). Changes in ndlp reference counting were not
reflected in function headers.

Update the stale comments in function headers to more accurately indicate
ndlp reference counting.
